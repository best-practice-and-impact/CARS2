"188","Office for National Statistics","Lazy fast code seems to be common place - people are not taught software engineering techniques and senior managers rarely see the importance in implementing these techniques properly. A lot of analytical scripts in my division are impenetrable as a result.","Using a lot of comments in code seems to be regarded as a good standard at ONS when this should not be the case. Good code should speak for itself as much as possible, this is the point in having high-level languages that people can interpret. Commenting frequently creates many issues:
- you now have to maintain all the comments as well as the code.
- the comments are now replicate the code but in a different user-defined language.
- if a comment is poorly written it can add confusion.
- it means the user can avoid learning how the code works and rely on comments for explanation.
- it increases the length of scripts - some analysis we did in our division demonstrated that longer scripts took longer for people to understand - so, in general, shorter scripts are easier for new users to understand.

The idea that you need to put comments everywhere seems to be proposed by people who don't really understand the language they are coding in. Production / analytical scripts should not act as tutorials - good clean code has few comments so that people who understand the language can quickly see what it's doing.","Help put in place good coding standards in projects people are actually working on - show people how they can improve their code.

More time to code and test code - good quality code can take a long time to produce. It needs to be refined, tested, better solutions need to be researched. I think that people would like their code to be reproducible but often they lack the time to learn how to do it or the support from senior management to spend time doing it.

Tutorial/lecture videos (youtube), podcasts and articles from software engineers/ data scientists in industry - we should aspire to code like the best in the industry.","A question on what language do you prefer to code in would be good as I by far prefer python, yet on the survey my response looks like I use R, SAS, SQL and python equally.

Also, perhaps what language would you like to code if it's one that you are not currently coding in. For e.g. SPSS users may want to learn and use R/python but their project work means they can't.

It should be specialised. The problem now is everyone thinks they are a coder, leading to crazy proliferation of bad code all over the place. Coding of productionised systems should be done by accredited coders who understand BOTH STATISTICS and CODING. Too often it is one or the other, and that leads to poorly understood and developed systems. "

""I think it is important to implement RAP in my work"": I actually think it would be highly detrimental for my work to produce it as a RAP, although I do think production-ready systems should be underpinned by RAPs. I work on a project where my team works in research and another team develops a RAP based on our recommendations from research. Developing a RAP to perform the research would significantly slow down our research. It would also hamper the flexibility of our approach; we would likely not try new ideas if we had to go through all the formal testing and management phases that underpin RAPs. We do draw on some principles from RAP to ensure e.g. repeatability, but our need to produce at pace means we can't fully commit to RAPs.

This mean there are a lot of people willing and able but who never get their coding skills up to a very useful level where they can, e.g. effectively QA the work of 'intensive coding' teams, or use code to quickly check other methods/present analysis. There are lots of great small initiatives to improve coding skills, but to really make the most of the potential here something large-scale and organised is needed."

More support to change attitudes and demonstrate benefits would be a big help.","I will share this survey with my team, however they are just starting out with learning to code and I feel a lot of the questions in the survey may intimidate them.
