``` {r echo = FALSE}

alphabetical <- as.character(dep_list$Var1[order(dep_list[[1]])])
urls <- sapply(alphabetical, URLencode)
links <- paste0('<li><a href="', urls, '.html">', alphabetical, "</a></li>")
html <- paste(links, collapse="\n\n")
html <- paste0("<ol>", html, "</ol>")
knitr::raw_html(html)
